    <h4>BOOTCAMP BLOG</h4>
    <p><strong>WEEK 1</strong></p>

<p>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</p>

<p> Going into this, I didn't have any preconceptions about what the bootcamp would be like or how
  it would be
  structured, so I can't say either way that it was or wasn't what I expected. I think the boot
  camp strikes a
  good balance between self problem solving which prepares us of what an actual job environment
  would be like,
  yet
  having the tutors there to help us out if we hit a blocker. What struck me out of the gate, is
  how quickly I
  am
  going to have to adapt to being in a learning environment again. The last time I was in school
  was about 8
  years
  ago so it's been a fair minute. It's a little intimidating but I am up for a challenge and I'm
  curious to
  see
  how well I will be able to retain all this new information. Big Ups to the tutors and the rest
  of the class,
  everybody has been very supportive and helpful. </p>

<p>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</p>

<p>The thing I am looking forward to the most is getting to the point where I have a big picture
  understanding
  of
  the entire process. Right now it feels like I am doing a jigsaw puzzle, not yet aware of the
  picture that
  will
  be created. I want to be able to create an app or interactive website from go to whoa! If I had
  to be more
  specific though, I'm looking forward to both <strong>Javascript</strong> and
  <strong>Python</strong> as they
  seem to be the nuts and bolts of coding. </p>

<p>What is something about you that can be learned by reading this blog?</p>

<p> I am originally from New Zealand and moved here impulsively in 2019 after winning a green card
  in a lottery.
  My
  primary hobbies are playing guitar, rock climbing and just recently coding. One thing people may
  not know
  about
  me is that I use to work as a deckhand in the superyacht industry in Europe. </p>

<p><strong>WEEK 2</strong></p>

<p>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering
  content
  and
  providing user experience?</p>

<p>The anology I have latched onto is that HTML is the builder, CSS is the artist and JavaScript is
  the wizard.
  They
  each play an important role in the creation of an app or webpage.
</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?</p>

<p>It didn't strike me immediately why pseudocoding is so important, but once I understood that
  programming is
  essentially just logic based problem solving I realised it's importance. The particular language
  you use is
  really just the tool you are using to solve the problem. Merely knowing how to use the tools and
  resources
  required to build a house doesn't mean you are going to be able to build a house. To be able to
  create what
  you
  are wanting to create requires the step by step knowledge and wisdom of how to do so. That is
  what good
  pseudocode is!
</p>

<p>What was helpful during Onboarding that made working remotely easier?</p>

<p>It's difficult to pin point a single aspect. Before onboarding I essentially had zero knowledge
  of anything
  within the programming realm. The mindset of being able to dig myself out of a hole instead of
  having to
  rely on
  other people I think is one trait that will be invaluable while working remotely.
</p>

<p>What hindered your progress during Onboarding?</p>

<p>In the first week I espicially suffered from a lack of organization. I was crunched for time and
  felt like
  the
  work load was being piled up faster than I was able to work through it.
</p>

<p>How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</p>

<p>I overcame the challenges by using a brute force attitude to time commitment. I was able to get
  through all
  the
  material by extending out the ammount of time I was studying. In the future I would like to hone
  in my
  efficiency when tackling new problems or material as to produce the greatest output I can muster
  in a timely
  manner that doesn't leave me exhausted. Work smarter not harder.
</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 3</strong></p>

<p>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</p>

<p>Definitely figuring out how to approach problem-solving, I felt confident going into this week.
  My
  understanding
  of JavaScript syntax and what I'm looking at on the screen is coming together. Although I was
  cut down to
  size
  and felt a little dissapointed in myself after this weeks project. I realized that merely
  knowing and
  understanding syntax doesn't get you very far. I need to become much more methodical and
  calculated in how I
  approach future projects.
</p>

<p>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data
  Structures),
  Bootstrap, or
  Atomic Design?</p>

<p>I would like to gain a deeper knowledge of what Bootstrap is capable of. Currently, I have a
  preference for
  using
  standard CSS, but I'm curious to see whether that will change once I'm more familiar with
  Bootstrap.
</p>

<p>What is your “Why”?</p>

<p>I'm a creative at my core. I enjoy the process of learning new skills and then using those skills
  to craft
  something that I or other people may find useful, interesting, or entertaining. I'd be lying if
  I said I'm
  driven by grandiose ideas of legacy or believing I'm going to have some big impact on the world.
  I figure I
  only
  get one life, and I may as well fill it with things I find interesting. Programming has fallen
  into that
  category.
</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 4</strong></p>

<p>What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?</p>

<p>This week, the most valuable lesson I learned was the significance of strategizing before diving
  into a
  project.
  By approaching tasks in a calculated manner, you ultimately save time in the long run, even if
  it means
  delaying
  the actual coding process. This involves thoroughly analyzing the project, planning the logic,
  and outlining
  the
  implementation steps.</p>

<p>What does it mean to develop good code?</p>

<p>I would say that high-quality code should prioritize readability. It should steer clear of
  unnecessary
  repetitions and be easily modifiable and reusable.</p>

<p>What does it mean to be a good developer?</p>

<p>I believe a good developer possesses a solid understanding of the problem at hand and can break
  it down into
  clear and actionable steps for resolution. Equally important is the ability to collaborate
  effectively with
  other developers, creating an environment where problem-solving becomes a streamlined and
  enjoyable journey
  for
  the entire team.</p>

<p>What is one thing that programmers hate doing?</p>

<p>As someone new to the world of programming, I am not yet familiar with the common frustrations
  experienced by
  programmers. However, I can easily imagine that debugging would fall into this category. The
  time-consuming
  nature of debugging leads me to believe that it's a safe assumption many programmers wouldn't
  have this type
  of
  work on the top of their list of favorite tasks.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 5</strong></p>

<p>What is pseudocode and how does it help with programming?</p>

<p>Pseudocode is a term used to describe the process that programmers follow to outline the steps
  needed to
  solve
  problems in a project. It is written in a non-coding language, allowing programmers to
  understand what the
  code
  should do without focusing on syntax. This skill is highly valuable in becoming a proficient
  programmer as
  it
  goes beyond specific programming languages and can be utilized by programmers working with
  different
  languages.
  Pseudocode enables collaboration among programmers by providing a clear understanding of the
  logical flow
  and
  actions required to achieve desired outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 6</strong></p>

<p>Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?</p>

<p>Currently, I find them challenging to use. I do recognize that they have the potential to
  streamline the
  coding process in the long run. However, since I'm still in the early stages of learning how to
  work with
  React, I find it more difficult compared to working with vanilla JavaScript.</p>

<p>What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with most of the frameworks out there. Right now, I would like to become more
  comfortable
  using React, the library we were introduced to this week. I have a good grasp of how functional
  components
  are used and how to utilize the useState hook, but there's a rabbit hole in React that I intend
  to dive
  into.
</p>

<p>Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final
  project.</p>

<p>I intend to work on a final project that involves incorporating a library capable of producing
  audio, which I
  can utilize to create aural training exercises for musicians. So I would like to explore and
  determine the most suitable library for my project, as well as learn how to leverage its full
  potential.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 7</strong></p>

<p>What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?</p>

<p>So far I have learnt and am familiar with some basic CLI commands such as cd, ls, mkdir, pwd and
  a few
  others. Yes CLI's still seem a little scary at this point because I know my current knowledge is
  merely
  scratching the surface. </p>

<p>If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 8</strong></p>

<p>Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone
  past? What do
  you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?</p>

<p>I think my biggest hurdles in the bootcamp have been more or less the same since day one. The
  answer being
  retention and how quicky I'm able to adapt to new concepts and information. It's incredibly fast
  paced, to a
  point where I'm questioning whether I'm absorbing all the information needed before we move on
  to the next
  topic </p>

<p>Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they
  the same
  ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your
  limitations?
</p>

<p>My idea since day one of the bootcamp, which hasn't changed, has been to create an app that aids
  in aural ear
  training for musicians. Thats the idea I'm gunning for but if for whatever reason that idea
  doesn't work out
  then I'm also considering an app targeted towards climbers, something similiar to mountain
  project or an app
  that keeps track of famous musicians and their current gear stack.
</p>

<p>What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week
  in
  JavaScript?</p>

<p>The syntax is a lot for refined and simplified compared to JavaScript which I will end up liking,
  although I
  found myself typing JavaScript into Python out of muscle memory ao I'm going to have to override
  my brain to
  get use to both languages.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 9</strong></p>

<p>What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?
</p>

<p>Both programming languages exhibit a strikingly similar structure, encompassing a common set of
  data types,
  conditional statements, and loops. However, a notable distinction lies in their syntax, where
  one language
  employs indentation instead of curly braces for code block delineation.</p>

<p>If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different?
  Would you
  have benefited?
</p>

<p>While acknowledging the Python language's intuitive syntax, I believe that learning JavaScript,
  with its
  meticulous nature, fosters a greater emphasis on code accuracy and precision. This emphasis on
  accuracy
  cultivates a more thorough approach to coding, which can be highly beneficial in developing
  robust and
  error-free software solutions.
</p>

<p>Think of a project or tech based tool that you use often and think about what the database
  structure might
  look like for it. Do you feel like you have a better understanding of how it works now and could
  you see
  yourself enjoying building something like that in the future?
</p>

<p>An app that I use a lot is the "guitartuna" app which provides a guitar tuner and metronome which
  I use for
  teaching. I could imagine the data structure would consist of <br></br> Tuning ID: A unique
  identifier for each
  tuning.
  Name: The name of the tuning, "Standard," "Drop D," "Half Step Down," etc.
  Notes: The specific notes corresponding to each string in the tuning.
  Chord ID: A unique identifier for each chord.
  Name: The name of the chord, like "C Major," "G7," "Dm," etc.
  Notes: The individual notes that make up the chord.
  Audio: Audio representation of the chord for playback.
  <br></br>
  I'm planning on building a similiar app for my cap stone project.
</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 10</strong></p>

<p>What are you struggling with the most in the Tech Stack so far and why?
</p>

<p>Theres no specific aspect I feel like I am struggling with but rather just suffering from a lack
  of a deeper
  understanding of the tech stack I am using. I understand them well enough to achieve the
  projects we have
  been given thus far but am aware that there are many rabbit holes espicially with react and
  django that I
  have not gone down.</p>

<p>What companies or people (local or not) would you like to hear talk during a Bootcamp lunch and
  learn?
</p>

<p> It would be really cool if we had an opportunity to speak with some of the big wigs of the tech
  industry.
  Google, Meta etc..
</p>

<p>After having built your first full-stack application, what things in your repertoire are a
  sticking point
  for you? Were you able to reconnect your React Restaurant to your Backend Bistro code? If so,
  what was that
  like, and if not, what hurdles did you need to jump?
</p>

<p>Yeah I did manage to reconnect my previous React Restaurant project to my backend bistro project
  and it was a
  lot easier than I expected. It was as simple as exchanging the link in the API call with the new
  http link
  from my API created in the backend bistro project. Really the only difficultly I faced with
  connecting the
  two was that I forgot I had to activate the CORS extension on google chrome and also forgot I
  had to type in
  the commnad "npm start" to view the react project in the browser. Which are two very minor
  problems.
</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 11</strong></p>

<p>What has been your experience overall thus far? What would you want to post as a
  “retrospective”?
</p>

<p>Overall my experience with Django and the Django Rest Framework, has been up and down. Getting
  the project
  set up seemed to be half the battle and was very frustrating. Although once I figured out how to
  get
  everything installed and running
  the project seemed fairly easy. Creating our own database in hindset was not the mountain it
  initally
  seemed, and the thunder client extension we used made running CRUD operations on our database
  infomation a
  piece of cake. </p>

<p><strong>WEEK 12</strong></p>

<p>Describe Agile Development or a specific ceremony (stand up, retro, sprints, etc.)”
</p>

<p>Agile Development is a organization routine that teams will take part in to struture their
  progression throughout a project. They can consist of "stand up", "retro", "sprints" and other
  cermonies. As an example "stand up" refers to the team meeting up at some point throughout the
  day usually in the morning, where each member can inform the others what tasks they completed in
  the past 24 hours, what tasks they plan to complete in the next 24hours and whether there are
  any issues that are challenging or preventing them for completing those tasks. </p>

<p>Convince someone who does not use frameworks why using a framework is beneficial. </p>

<p>Using a framework essentially is going to allow you to bypass or streamline certain tasks when
  building a project which will save time and increase the effiency of your build. Another
  important aspect of a lot of frameworks is that they allow for scalability, offering tools and
  practices to help handle the increasing complexity that large projects will face.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 13</strong></p>

<p>After making it through the tech stack, where do you think your current gaps are?”
</p>

<p>Since the bootcamp has moved so quickly I think I will need to spend time after our capstone
  project to go back and really refine my knowledge of the different languages and frameworks we
  have been introduced to. I cannot think of a sepcific gap but rather a general lack of a DEEP
  understanding on the tech stack we have been using.</p>

<p>What is your opinion on documentation? (MVP, Stories, Points, Markdown, Personas, Readme,
  Pseudocode, etc.)</p>

<p>I have mixed feelings on documentation. I see it's benefit, and I think it's benefit would be
  espicailly evident when doing a large project in a team that requires collaboration. Although it
  some cases, there can be risk of over planning a project. When there is limited time to complete
  a project there is a balance to strike between knowing how much planning will aid you in meeting
  a deadline with a quality product and when you've crossed a line into wasting time you could
  spend actually jumping in a coding the project.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 14</strong></p>

<p>What was your experience like overall in the Bootcamp?
</p>

<p>There is no doubt that this bootcamp was worth it. As a person who had zero prior experience in
  coding or anything tech related I almost cannot believe the ammount I was able to learn in a 14
  week period. The group I was with and our tutors were all great, supportive helpful people to be
  around. It was definately a challenging course and there were plenty of time I was feeling
  pretty overwhelmed and stressed out with all the deadlines and sheer volume of material I needed
  to learn. Now that the course is over however it's become clear to me that I thrive in that sort
  of environment, I like the structure, the challenege and the time crunch of the projects. It
  offers a level of drive and adrenaline which is an odd combination of stress and fufillment.</p>

<p>Take a look back at your blog posts over the last 16 weeks. Where do you see yourself growing
  the most? What is one thing that pops out as you being misinformed or that you think is funny
  compared to what you know now?</p>

<p>I think what I find funny is looking back on what I thought of as challenging tasks at the
  beginning of the bootcamp. Things as simple as understand what loops and functions were seemed
  to be on par with quantim physics only for them to become just second nature after a few weeks.
  Now that the course is finished I plan to keep studying what I have learnt and would like to
  take a look at C# and .net which were not covered in the bootcamp. </p>

<p>If someone important was to read this blog, who would flatter you the most?
</p>

<p>Theres nobody that I specifically look up to in the tech industry in all honesty but I would
  certainly get a buzz from knowing that any of the tech giant were to somehow stumble upon my
  blog. Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, Elon Musk etc..</p>

<p>Will you continue this blog throughout the rest of post-work? How about for the rest of the
  year? How about the rest of your life? Will you keep posting? Will you need to be stopped?</p>

<p>Yet to be seen, I may keep adding to this blog but on a less frequent basis and only when
  something note worthy comes up along my journey into become a programmer.</p>
